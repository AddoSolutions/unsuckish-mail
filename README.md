# Mail that Doesn't Suck

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/AddoSolutions/unsuckish-mail.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/AddoSolutions/unsuckish-mail)

This is simply a mail server, that is written in a language that more than 5 people know, and utilizes modern APIs.  Also allows for much more extensible configuration and is WAY easier to deploy and manage.

As if you didn't need more reasons that this is awesome, it uses a modern database engine (MongoDB) which makes for MUCH faster and scaleable deployments.
